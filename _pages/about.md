<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Nice to meet you! I'm Weiliang Luo (ÁΩó‰ºüÊ¢Å) from Dalian, Liaoning, China. I have just graduated from [CCME, PKU](https://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/). I'm going to pursue my Ph. D. degree at [MIT Chemistry](https://chemistry.mit.edu/) in 2023 Fall.

My research interest is molecular modeling/simulation, rational drug design, and AI for chemistry. I believe that scientific computation and machine learning will replace serendipity with certainty in traditional, labor-intensive chemical discovery.

I conducted my undergraduate research on graph neural networks (GNN) for ADME/T property prediction at [Molecular Design Lab](http://mdl.ipc.pku.edu.cn/mdlweb/home.php), supervised by Prof. Luhua Lai and Dr. Jianfeng Pei.

As a research intern at [DP Technology](https://www.dp.tech/), I am focusing on cutting-edge algorithms for the free energy evaluation of small drug molecules. I contributed to the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, chemoinformatics, and software engineering in the free energy perturbation (FEP) module of the next-generation drug design platform [Hermite](https://hermite.dp.tech/). My undergraduate thesis completed here is about accurate FEP calculation and p*K* <sub>a</sub> prediction for drug-like molecules with complex acid-base equilibrium.

I'm always wary of data-driven methods when it comes to real, risk-sensitive scenarios with limited quality and quantity of available data. Therefore, I'm on my way combining physics and statistics, understanding the relationship between data and models, and decoding the structure of the chemical space. Hope to find ones who are also excited about this vision.

Thank you for your visiting!
