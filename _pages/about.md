<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I have just graduated from [CCME, PKU](https://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/). I am going to [MIT Chemistry]() to pursue my Ph. D. degree in 2023 Fall.

My research interest is molecular modeling, molecular simulation, rational drug design and AI in chemistry.

I conducted my undergraduate research on graph neural networks (GNN) for ADME/T property prediction at [Molecular Design Lab](http://mdl.ipc.pku.edu.cn/mdlweb/home.php), supervised by Prof. Luhua Lai and Dr. Jianfeng Pei. 

As a research intern at [DP Technology](https://www.dp.tech/), I am focusing on the cutting-edge algorithms for the free energy evaluation of small drug molecules. I contributed to the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, chemoinformatics and software engineering in the free energy perturbation (FEP) module of the next-generation drug design platform [Hermite](https://hermite.dp.tech/).
