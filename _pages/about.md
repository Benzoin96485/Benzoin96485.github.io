<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Nice to meet you! I'm Weiliang Luo (ÁΩó‰ºüÊ¢Å) from Dalian, Liaoning, China. I'm a Ph. D. student at [MIT Chemistry](https://chemistry.mit.edu/), advised by [Prof. Heather J. Kulik](http://hjkgrp.mit.edu/author/heather-j.-kulik/).

My research interest is molecular modeling/simulation, rational molecular design, and AI for chemistry. I'm working on the multiscale modeling of enzymatic catalysis across electronic and atomistic structures, including:

- Next-generation machine learning potential for biochemical reactive systems.
- Automatic cluster model and QM/MM simulation workflow.
- Mechanism study of novel enzymatic reactions.
- Application of density functional theory and correlated wave function methods on biochemistry.

My undergraduate study is at [CCME, PKU](https://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/). I conducted my undergraduate research on graph neural networks (GNN) for ADME/T property prediction at [Molecular Design Lab](http://mdl.ipc.pku.edu.cn/mdlweb/home.php), supervised by Prof. Luhua Lai and Dr. Jianfeng Pei.

When I was a research intern at [DP Technology](https://www.dp.tech/), I focused on cutting-edge algorithms for the free energy evaluation of small drug molecules. I contributed to the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, chemoinformatics, and software engineering in the free energy perturbation (FEP) module of the next-generation drug design platform [Hermite](https://hermite.dp.tech/). My undergraduate thesis completed here was about accurate FEP calculation and p*K* <sub>a</sub> prediction for drug-like molecules with complex acid-base equilibrium.

I believe that scientific computation and machine learning will replace serendipity with certainty in traditional, labor-intensive chemical discovery. However, I'm always wary of data-driven methods when it comes to real, risk-sensitive scenarios with limited quality and quantity of available data. Therefore, I'm on my way combining physics and statistics, understanding the relationship between data and models, and decoding the structure of the chemical space. Hope to find ones who are also excited about this vision.

Thank you for your visiting!
